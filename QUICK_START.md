## Tips & Best Practices

### For Communications Team

- **Save frequently** - WordPress auto-saves, but manual saves ensure data is captured
- **Use clear slugs** - Keep URLs short and descriptive (e.g., `/easter-2025` not `/easter-celebration-event-2025`)
- **Complete all sections** - Even if brief (helps with future campaigns)
- **Copy channel plan from similar campaigns** - Save time by duplicating successful approaches
- **Archive old campaigns** - Keep dashboard focused on active work

### For Ministry Leaders

- **Review promptly** - Helps communications team meet deadlines
- **Be specific in comments** - Instead of "change this," say "change date to March 15"
- **Ask questions** - If something is unclear, ask before accepting
- **Save the link** - Bookmark or save email with brief link for future reference

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find brief in dashboard
→ Check the status filters (Draft, Pending, Accepted, Archived)

### Shareable link shows 404
→ Contact IT - permalink settings may need updating

### Changes not saving
→ Check your internet connection and try again

### Email notifications not arriving
→ Check spam folder, verify email in Settings → Campaign Briefs

### Can't unlock brief
→ Ensure you're logged in as Administrator or Editor
